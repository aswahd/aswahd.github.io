Hi! I'm Assefa, a first-year PhD student in the Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging at the University of Alberta. I completed my master's degree in Computer Software from [University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.ac.kr/eng/) (가연구소대학교) in Daejeon, South Korea, and obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronic Information Engineering from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn) (电子科技大学) in Chengdu, China.

I am interested in exploring methods to apply large pre-trained models in general computer vision to the field of medical imaging. This involves techniques such as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), model size reduction through pruning, fast adaptation, and life-long (continual) learning. My goal is to accomplish this with minimal expert-labeled data by leveraging techniques from self-supervised learning.

If you’re interested in collaborating, feel free to email me at assefas221@gmail.com or wahd@ualberta.ca, or send me a DM on social media.
